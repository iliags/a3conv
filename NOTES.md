# Notes

There should be two routes to use the application:

- Specify root game folder
  - Search the directory for WRS archives
  - Extract archives into output folder
    - Default is output/original/(wrs_name)
  - Convert extracted files into new formats
    - Default is output/converted/(wrs_name)
    - Optional file format organization
      - `image` - Images
      - `sound` - Audio files
      - `script` - WMP and WDL files
- Specify specific file/archive
  - Same as root folder, but only for one archive
